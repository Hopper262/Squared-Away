Simple_HUD v1.0pre1
---------------------
Lua HUD for Aleph One
by Hopper

A complete HUD with no images. Good for experimenting with the Lua HUD API.

Install:

1. Place the script "Simple_HUD.lua" wherever you like. Your Aleph One
   preferences directory would be a good place.

2. Launch Aleph One (0.22pre2), and go to "Preferences", then "Environment".

   2a. Check the box "Use HUD Script".
   
   2b. Next to "Script File", click the words "(no valid selection)" to
       open a file dialog. Navigate to the directory where you saved
       Simple_HUD.lua, and select it by double-clicking its name.

   2c. Click "Accept", then "Return" to exit the preferences.

3. You're all set now; go create some carnage.
